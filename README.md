# MusicRecommendationApp

### Purpose and Motivation
The purpose of this application is to provide statistics of a user's Spotify listening patterns and craft personalized song recommendations to aid the user in discovering new music. This project is designed as a locally run Windows-based application and requires the user to provide authentication credentials to their Spotify profile. Once these credentials are provided, the app can properly access the user's information.

I chose to create this application because I felt Spotify's built in recommendation feature could be expanded upon and thought it would be insightful gaining more information on my own music listening patterns.

### Design Choices
The design choice of using Python is due to the spotipy library which provides a wide range of API methods allowing for properly communicating with Spotify. The UI portion of this application was developed using the tkinter library. This was my first time working with tkinter and thus was chosen both since it is included in native Python and for myself to gain exposure to the library.
